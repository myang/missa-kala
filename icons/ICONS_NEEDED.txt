You need to add 3 icon files to this folder:

1. icon16.png (16x16 pixels)
2. icon48.png (48x48 pixels)
3. icon128.png (128x128 pixels)

QUICK SOLUTION:
1. Go to https://favicon.io/favicon-generator/
2. Type a fish emoji 🐟 or use text "MK"
3. Download the generated icons
4. Rename them to match the names above
5. Place them in this folder

OR use any image editor to create simple square icons.

The extension won't load without these icons!
